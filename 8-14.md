![Python vs Swift](https://michaelckennedy.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/python-vs-swift.png)

#### 8. Interfaces / protocols

  * ###### Python
    - Documentation:
        > Interfaces is not necessary in Python. This is because Python has proper multiple inheritance, and also ducktyping, which means that the places where you must have interfaces in Java, you don't have to have them in Python. 

        > That said, there is still several uses of interfaces. Some of them are covered by Pythons Abstract Base Classes, introduced in Python 2.6. That's useful if you want to make baseclasses that can not be instantiated, but provide a specific interface or part of an implementation.

        >Another usage is if you somehow want to specify that an object implements a specific interface, and you can use ABC's for that too by subclassing from them. Another way is zope.interface, a module that is a part of the Zope Component Architecture, a really awesomely cool component framework. Here you don't subclass from the interfaces, but instead mark classes (or even instances) as implementing an interface. This can also be used to look up components from a component registry. 

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        class IInterface:
            def show(self): raise NotImplementedError

        class MyClass(IInterface):
            def show(self): print "Hello World!"
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Swift does not use interface.
        
        > A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        class Obj1: MyEngine {
           func doWork() -> Bool {
               print("in Obj1 doWork()")
               return true
           }
       }

       class Obj2: MyEngine {
           func doWork() -> Bool {
               print("in Obj2 doWork()")
               return true
           }
       }
        ```

#### 9. Inheritance / extension

  * ###### Python
    - Documentation:
        > Python supports a limited form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this:

        > Of course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this:

        > The name BaseClassName must be defined in a scope containing the derived class definition. In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the base class is defined in another module:

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
           <statement-1>
           .
           .
           .
           <statement-N>
           
        class DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you do not have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling). Extensions are similar to categories in Objective-C. (Unlike Objective-C categories, Swift extensions do not have names.)

        > Extensions in Swift can:
          <br>1. Add computed instance properties and computed type properties
          <br>2. Define instance methods and type methods
          <br>3. Provide new initializers
          <br>4. Define subscripts
          <br>5. Define and use new nested types
          <br>6. Make an existing type conform to a protocol

    - Code Example:
        ```
        extension SomeType {
            // new functionality to add to SomeType goes here
        }
        ```

#### 10. Reflection
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > A Python script can find out about the type, class, attributes and methods of an object. This is referred to as reflection or introspection.
        
        > Reflection-enabling functions include type(), isinstance(), callable(), dir() and getattr().

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        class Plant: pass                        # Dummy class
        class Tree(Plant): pass                  # Dummy class derived from Plant
        tree = Tree()                            # A new instance of Tree class
        print isinstance(tree, Tree)             # True
        print isinstance(tree, Plant)            # True
        print isinstance(tree, object)           # True
        print type(tree) is Tree                 # False
        print type(tree).__name__ == "instance"  # True
        print tree.__class__.__name__ == "Tree"  # True
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Reflection in Swift is easy using the struct Mirror, with it we can inspect the names and types of properties in an instance of a struct or an instance of a class.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        class Fruit {
            var name="Apple"
        }

        reflect(Fruit()).count         // 1
        reflect(Fruit())[0].0          // "name"
        reflect(Fruit())[0].1.summary  // "Apple"
        ```

#### 11. Memory management
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.

        > At the lowest level, a raw memory allocator ensures that there is enough room in the private heap for storing all Python-related data by interacting with the memory manager of the operating system. On top of the raw memory allocator, several object-specific allocators operate on the same heap and implement distinct memory management policies adapted to the peculiarities of every object type. For example, integer objects are managed differently within the heap than strings, tuples or dictionaries because integers imply different storage requirements and speed/space tradeoffs. The Python memory manager thus delegates some of the work to the object-specific allocators, but ensures that the latter operate within the bounds of the private heap.
        
        > It is important to understand that the management of the Python heap is performed by the interpreter itself and that the user has no control over it, even if she regularly manipulates object pointers to memory blocks inside that heap. The allocation of heap space for Python objects and other internal buffers is performed on demand by the Python memory manager through the Python/C API functions listed in this document.
        
        > To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on Python objects with the functions exported by the C library: malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free(). This will result in mixed calls between the C allocator and the Python memory manager with fatal consequences, because they implement different algorithms and operate on different heaps. However, one may safely allocate and release memory blocks with the C library allocator for individual purposes, as shown in the following example:

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        PyObject *res;
        char *buf = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZ); /* for I/O */

        if (buf == NULL)
            return PyErr_NoMemory();
        ...Do some I/O operation involving buf...
        res = PyBytes_FromString(buf);
        free(buf); /* malloc'ed */
        return res;
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management “just works” in Swift, and you do not need to think about memory management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed.
        
        > However, in a few cases ARC requires more information about the relationships between parts of your code in order to manage memory for you. This chapter describes those situations and shows how you enable ARC to manage all of your app’s memory. Using ARC in Swift is very similar to the approach described in Transitioning to ARC Release Notes for using ARC with Objective-C.
        
        - Code Example:
        ```
        class Person {
            let name: String
            init(name: String) {
                self.name = name
                print("\(name) is being initialized")
            }
            deinit {
                print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
            }
        }
        ```

#### 12. Comparisons of references and values
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Strings in python are contiguous series of characters delimited by single or double quotes. Python don’t have any separate data type for characters so they are represented as a single character string.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        s1 = 'abc def ghi'
        s2 = 'def ghi abc'
        set1 = set(s1.split(' '))
        set2 = set(s2.split(' '))
        print set1 == set2
         ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: string and character equality, prefix equality, and suffix equality.

        > String and character equality is checked with the “equal to” operator (==) and the “not equal to” operator (!=), as described in Comparison Operators:

    - Code Example:
        ```
        let x = "hello"
        let y = "hello"
        let isEqual = (x == y)
        ```
#### 13. Null/nil references
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > In Python, the 'null' object is the singleton None. The best way to check things for "Noneness" is to use the identity operator, is:

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        if foo is None:
            ...
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Regarding equivalents:
         <br>1. NULL has no equivalent in Swift.
         <br>2. nil is also called nil in Swift
         <br>3. Nil has no equivalent in Swift
         <br>4. [NSNull null] can be accessed in Swift as NSNull()
        
    - Code Example:
        ```
        class HTMLElement {

            let name: String
            let text: String?

            lazy var asHTML: () -> String = {
                [unowned self] in
                if let text = self.text {
                    return "<\(self.name)>\(text)</\(self.name)>"
                } else {
                    return "<\(self.name) />"
                }
            }

            init(name: String, text: String? = nil) {
                self.name = name
                self.text = text
            }

            deinit {
                print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
            }

        }
        ```

#### 14. Errors and exception handling
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:

        > Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here:

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        >>> while True:
        ...     try:
        ...         x = int(raw_input("Please enter a number: "))
        ...         break
        ...     except ValueError:
        ...         print "Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again..."
        ...
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in your program. Swift provides first-class support for throwing, catching, propagating, and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime.

        > Some operations aren’t guaranteed to always complete execution or produce a useful output. Optionals are used to represent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it’s often useful to understand what caused the failure, so that your code can respond accordingly.
        
        > As an example, consider the task of reading and processing data from a file on disk. There are a number of ways this task can fail, including the file not existing at the specified path, the file not having read permissions, or the file not being encoded in a compatible format. Distinguishing among these different situations allows a program to resolve some errors and to communicate to the user any errors it can’t resolve.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        struct Item {
            var price: Int
            var count: Int
        }

        class VendingMachine {
            var inventory = [
                "Candy Bar": Item(price: 12, count: 7),
                "Chips": Item(price: 10, count: 4),
                "Pretzels": Item(price: 7, count: 11)
            ]
            var coinsDeposited = 0

            func vend(itemNamed name: String) throws {
                guard let item = inventory[name] else {
                    throw VendingMachineError.invalidSelection
                }

                guard item.count > 0 else {
                    throw VendingMachineError.outOfStock
                }

                guard item.price <= coinsDeposited else {
                    throw VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: item.price - coinsDeposited)
                }

                coinsDeposited -= item.price

                var newItem = item
                newItem.count -= 1
                inventory[name] = newItem

                print("Dispensing \(name)")
            }
        }
        ```

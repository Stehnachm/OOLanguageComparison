![Python vs Swift](https://michaelckennedy.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/python-vs-swift.png)

#### 8. Interfaces / protocols

  * ###### Python
    - Documentation:
        > Interfaces is not necessary in Python. This is because Python has proper multiple inheritance, and also ducktyping, which means that the places where you must have interfaces in Java, you don't have to have them in Python. 

        > That said, there is still several uses of interfaces. Some of them are covered by Pythons Abstract Base Classes, introduced in Python 2.6. That's useful if you want to make baseclasses that can not be instantiated, but provide a specific interface or part of an implementation.

        >Another usage is if you somehow want to specify that an object implements a specific interface, and you can use ABC's for that too by subclassing from them. Another way is zope.interface, a module that is a part of the Zope Component Architecture, a really awesomely cool component framework. Here you don't subclass from the interfaces, but instead mark classes (or even instances) as implementing an interface. This can also be used to look up components from a component registry. 

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        class IInterface:
            def show(self): raise NotImplementedError

        class MyClass(IInterface):
            def show(self): print "Hello World!"
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Swift does not use interface.
        
        > A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        class Obj1: MyEngine {
           func doWork() -> Bool {
               print("in Obj1 doWork()")
               return true
           }
       }

       class Obj2: MyEngine {
           func doWork() -> Bool {
               print("in Obj2 doWork()")
               return true
           }
       }
        ```

#### 9. Inheritance / extension

  * ###### Python
    - Documentation:
        > The Listener class is an “abstract” base class for any objects which wish to register to receive notifications of new messages on the bus.

        > A Listener can be used in two ways; the default is to call the Listener with a new message, or by calling the method on_message_received.

        > For event handlers, Python has its own events.EventHandler(sender) class, which is a simple event handling class that manages callbacks to be executed.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        def on_message_received(self, msg):
            print(msg)
        class MyClass(object):
            def __init__(self):
            self.anevent = EventHandler(self)
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > In Swift, it use eventing mechanism to implement event handling.

        > Events provide a generic mechanism for raising notifications that can be handled by multiple observers.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        public class Event<T> {
            public typealias EventHandler = T -> ()
            private var eventHandlers = [Invocable]()
            public func raise(data: T) {
                for handler in self.eventHandlers {
                    handler.invoke(data)
                }
            }
            public func addHandler<U: AnyObject>(target: U,
            handler: (U) -> EventHandler) -> Disposable {
                let wrapper = EventHandlerWrapper(target: target,
                handler: handler, event: self)
                eventHandlers.append(wrapper)
                return wrapper
            }
        }
        private protocol Invocable: class {
            func invoke(data: Any)
        }
        ```

#### 10. Reflection
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Possibly the simplest design pattern is the singleton, which is a way to provide one and only one object of a particular type.

        > To accomplish this, you must take control of object creation out of the hands of the programmer.

        > Singleton could be thread safe in Python by manipulate thread before using singleton object such as lock the thread.

        > The singleton instance could be lazily instantiated in Python.

        > Lazy instantiation makes sure that the object gets created when it's actually needed. Consider lazy instantiation as the way to work with reduced resources and create them only when needed.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        #This is a thread unsafe example.
        class EventBus(object):
            clients = []

        def __new__(cls):
            if not hasattr(cls, 'instance'):
                cls.instance = super(EventBus, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls.instance

        # This is a thread safe example
        import threading
        class EventBus(object):
            _instance = None
            _lock = threading.Lock()

        def __new__(cls):
            if EventBus._instance is None:
                with EventBus._lock:
                    if EventBus._instance is None:
                        EventBus._instance = super(EventBus, cls).__new__(cls)
            return EventBus._instance

        def __init__(self):
            self.clients = []
        # Lazy instantiation of singleton
        class Singleton:
            __instance = None
            def __init__(self):
                if not Singleton.__instance:
                    print("__init__ method called...")
                else:
                    print("Instance already created:", self. getInstance())
        @classmethod
        def getInstance(cls):
            if not cls.__instance:
                cls.__instance = Singleton()
        return cls.__instance
        s = Singleton() ## class initialized, but object not created
        print("Object created", Singleton.getInstance()) ##Object gets...
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > In Swift, the most straightforward technique to create a singleton is by defining a global variable.

        > Static property is another method to implement singleton in Swift.

        > In Swift, when we define global variable or use static property to implement singleton, the execution is actually lazy default.

        > In Swift3, because both global variable and static property are lazy initialized, thread is actually safe all the time.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        //Define global variable to implement singleton
        let sharedNetworkManager = NetworkManager(baseURL: API.baseURL)
        class NetworkManager {
            // MARK: - Properties
            let baseURL: URL
            // Initialization
            init(baseURL: URL) {
                self.baseURL = baseURL
            }
        }
        // Use static property to implement singleton in Swift
        class NetworkManager {
            // MARK: - Properties
            static let shared = NetworkManager(baseURL: API.baseURL)
            // MARK: -
            let baseURL: URL
            // Initialization
            private init(baseURL: URL) {
                self.baseURL = baseURL
            }
        }
        ```

#### 11. Memory management
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Procedural programming is actually one of the programming style for Python.

        > Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are called as needed.

        > This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        def DoAdd(MyList):
        Sum = 0
        if type(MyList) is list:
            for X in MyList:
                Sum += X
        return Sum
        MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print(DoAdd(MyList))
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > In my perspective, Swift is not a procedural programming language.

#### 12. Comparisons of references and values
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > The functional coding style treats everything like a math equation.

        > Python indeed support functional programming.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        import functools
        MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Sum = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, MyList)
        print(Sum)
         ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Though Swift is not a pure functional programming language like Haskell, Swift really support functional programming and has some functional programming features.

        > For example, Swift contains many high level functions, such as pattern matching, type inference etc.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        func saveMeFromMadness(elements: [Int]) -> Int {
            var sum = 0
            for element in elements {
                sum += element
            }
            return sum
        }
        // Somewhere in ViewController
        saveMeFromMadness(elements: [1, 2, 3])
        // Somewhere in NextViewController
        saveMeFromMadness(elements: [4, 5, 6])
        ```
#### 13. Null/nil references
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > In Python 2.7, the thread module(or \_thread in Python 3) provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads (also called light-weight processes or tasks) — multiple threads of control sharing their global data space.

        > For synchronization, simple locks (also called mutexes or binary semaphores) are provided. The threading module provides an easier to use and higher-level threading API built on top of this module.

        > In Python, we use threading module to start new threads.

        > The threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads.

        > Furthermore, we use multithread priority queue to hold a specified number of thread ite.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/python3

        import queue
        import threading
        import time

        exitFlag = 0

        class myThread (threading.Thread):
        def __init__(self, threadID, name, q):
            threading.Thread.__init__(self)
            self.threadID = threadID
            self.name = name
            self.q = q
            def run(self):
                print ("Starting " + self.name)
                process_data(self.name, self.q)
                print ("Exiting " + self.name)

        def process_data(threadName, q):
            while not exitFlag:
                queueLock.acquire()
                if not workQueue.empty():
                    data = q.get()
                    queueLock.release()
                    print ("%s processing %s" % (threadName, data))
                else:
                    queueLock.release()
                    time.sleep(1)

        threadList = ["Thread-1", "Thread-2", "Thread-3"]
        nameList = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"]
        queueLock = threading.Lock()
        workQueue = queue.Queue(10)
        threads = []
        threadID = 1

        # Create new threads
        for tName in threadList:
            thread = myThread(threadID, tName, workQueue)
            thread.start()
            threads.append(thread)
            threadID += 1

        # Fill the queue
        queueLock.acquire()
        for word in nameList:
            workQueue.put(word)
            queueLock.release()

        # Wait for queue to empty
        while not workQueue.empty():
            pass

        # Notify threads it's time to exit
        exitFlag = 1

        # Wait for all threads to complete
        for t in threads:
            t.join()
            print ("Exiting Main Thread")
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > The Thread class supports semantics similar to those of Operation for monitoring the runtime condition of a thread.

        > You can use these semantics to cancel the execution of a thread or determine if the thread is still executing or has finished its task.
        
        > For Swift3, the multiple threading is generally implemented by background execution.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
            // Download file or perform expensive task

            DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Update the UI
            }
        }
        ```

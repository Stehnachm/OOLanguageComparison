## <u>__*OO Language Comparison: Python vs Swift*__</u>
![Python vs Swift](https://michaelckennedy.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/python-vs-swift.png)

#### 15. Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types

  * ###### Python
    - Documentation:
        > The lambda operator or lambda function is a way to create small     anonymous functions.

        > A closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes regardless of whether those scopes are still present in memory.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        >>> g = lambda x: x**2
        >>>
        >>> print g(8)
        64
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Closures are techniques for implementing lexically scoped name binding in languages with first-class functions.

        > Closures and lambda expression always are same thing.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        myFunction { (x: Int, y: Int) -> Int in
            return x + y
        }
        ```

#### 16. Implementation of listeners and event handlers

  * ###### Python
    - Documentation:
        > The Listener class is an “abstract” base class for any objects which wish to register to receive notifications of new messages on the bus.

        > A Listener can be used in two ways; the default is to call the Listener with a new message, or by calling the method on_message_received.

        > For event handlers, Python has its own events.EventHandler(sender) class, which is a simple event handling class that manages callbacks to be executed.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        def on_message_received(self, msg):
            print(msg)
        class MyClass(object):
            def __init__(self):
            self.anevent = EventHandler(self)
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > In Swift, it use eventing mechanism to implement event handling.

        > Events provide a generic mechanism for raising notifications that can be handled by multiple observers.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        public class Event<T> {
            public typealias EventHandler = T -> ()
            private var eventHandlers = [Invocable]()
            public func raise(data: T) {
                for handler in self.eventHandlers {
                    handler.invoke(data)
                }
            }
            public func addHandler<U: AnyObject>(target: U,
            handler: (U) -> EventHandler) -> Disposable {
                let wrapper = EventHandlerWrapper(target: target,
                handler: handler, event: self)
                eventHandlers.append(wrapper)
                return wrapper
            }
        }
        private protocol Invocable: class {
            func invoke(data: Any)
        }
        ```

#### 17. Singleton
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Possibly the simplest design pattern is the singleton, which is a way to provide one and only one object of a particular type.

        > To accomplish this, you must take control of object creation out of the hands of the programmer.

        > Singleton could be thread safe in Python by manipulate thread before using singleton object such as lock the thread.

        > The singleton instance could be lazily instantiated in Python.

        > Lazy instantiation makes sure that the object gets created when it's actually needed. Consider lazy instantiation as the way to work with reduced resources and create them only when needed.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        #This is a thread unsafe example.
        class EventBus(object):
            clients = []

        def __new__(cls):
            if not hasattr(cls, 'instance'):
                cls.instance = super(EventBus, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls.instance

        # This is a thread safe example
        import threading
        class EventBus(object):
            _instance = None
            _lock = threading.Lock()

        def __new__(cls):
            if EventBus._instance is None:
                with EventBus._lock:
                    if EventBus._instance is None:
                        EventBus._instance = super(EventBus, cls).__new__(cls)
            return EventBus._instance

        def __init__(self):
            self.clients = []
        # Lazy instantiation of singleton
        class Singleton:
            __instance = None
            def __init__(self):
                if not Singleton.__instance:
                    print("__init__ method called...")
                else:
                    print("Instance already created:", self. getInstance())
        @classmethod
        def getInstance(cls):
            if not cls.__instance:
                cls.__instance = Singleton()
        return cls.__instance
        s = Singleton() ## class initialized, but object not created
        print("Object created", Singleton.getInstance()) ##Object gets...
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > In Swift, the most straightforward technique to create a singleton is by defining a global variable.

        > Static property is another method to implement singleton in Swift.

        > In Swift, when we define global variable or use static property to implement singleton, the execution is actually lazy default.

        > In Swift3, because both global variable and static property are lazy initialized, thread is actually safe all the time.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        //Define global variable to implement singleton
        let sharedNetworkManager = NetworkManager(baseURL: API.baseURL)
        class NetworkManager {
            // MARK: - Properties
            let baseURL: URL
            // Initialization
            init(baseURL: URL) {
                self.baseURL = baseURL
            }
        }
        // Use static property to implement singleton in Swift
        class NetworkManager {
            // MARK: - Properties
            static let shared = NetworkManager(baseURL: API.baseURL)
            // MARK: -
            let baseURL: URL
            // Initialization
            private init(baseURL: URL) {
                self.baseURL = baseURL
            }
        }
        ```

#### 18. Procedural programming
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > Procedural programming is actually one of the programming style for Python.

        > Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are called as needed.

        > This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        def DoAdd(MyList):
        Sum = 0
        if type(MyList) is list:
            for X in MyList:
                Sum += X
        return Sum
        MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print(DoAdd(MyList))
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > In my perspective, Swift is not a procedural programming language.

#### 19. Functional programming
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > The functional coding style treats everything like a math equation.

        > Python indeed support functional programming.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        import functools
        MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Sum = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, MyList)
        print(Sum)
         ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > Though Swift is not a pure functional programming language like Haskell, Swift really support functional programming and has some functional programming features.

        > For example, Swift contains many high level functions, such as pattern matching, type inference etc.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        func saveMeFromMadness(elements: [Int]) -> Int {
            var sum = 0
            for element in elements {
                sum += element
            }
            return sum
        }
        // Somewhere in ViewController
        saveMeFromMadness(elements: [1, 2, 3])
        // Somewhere in NextViewController
        saveMeFromMadness(elements: [4, 5, 6])
        ```
#### 20. Multithreading
  * ###### Python
    - Documentations:
        > In Python 2.7, the thread module(or \_thread in Python 3) provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads (also called light-weight processes or tasks) — multiple threads of control sharing their global data space.

        > For synchronization, simple locks (also called mutexes or binary semaphores) are provided. The threading module provides an easier to use and higher-level threading API built on top of this module.

        > In Python, we use threading module to start new threads.

        > The threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads.

        > Furthermore, we use multithread priority queue to hold a specified number of thread ite.

    - Code Example:
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/python3

        import queue
        import threading
        import time

        exitFlag = 0

        class myThread (threading.Thread):
        def __init__(self, threadID, name, q):
            threading.Thread.__init__(self)
            self.threadID = threadID
            self.name = name
            self.q = q
            def run(self):
                print ("Starting " + self.name)
                process_data(self.name, self.q)
                print ("Exiting " + self.name)

        def process_data(threadName, q):
            while not exitFlag:
                queueLock.acquire()
                if not workQueue.empty():
                    data = q.get()
                    queueLock.release()
                    print ("%s processing %s" % (threadName, data))
                else:
                    queueLock.release()
                    time.sleep(1)

        threadList = ["Thread-1", "Thread-2", "Thread-3"]
        nameList = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"]
        queueLock = threading.Lock()
        workQueue = queue.Queue(10)
        threads = []
        threadID = 1

        # Create new threads
        for tName in threadList:
            thread = myThread(threadID, tName, workQueue)
            thread.start()
            threads.append(thread)
            threadID += 1

        # Fill the queue
        queueLock.acquire()
        for word in nameList:
            workQueue.put(word)
            queueLock.release()

        # Wait for queue to empty
        while not workQueue.empty():
            pass

        # Notify threads it's time to exit
        exitFlag = 1

        # Wait for all threads to complete
        for t in threads:
            t.join()
            print ("Exiting Main Thread")
        ```
  * ###### Swift
    - Documentations:
        > The Thread class supports semantics similar to those of Operation for monitoring the runtime condition of a thread.

        > You can use these semantics to cancel the execution of a thread or determine if the thread is still executing or has finished its task.
        
        > For Swift3, the multiple threading is generally implemented by background execution.

    - Code Example:
        ```
        DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
            // Download file or perform expensive task

            DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Update the UI
            }
        }
        ```

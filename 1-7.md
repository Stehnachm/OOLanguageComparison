#### 1. Language purpose/genesis
  Why was the language created?
  * ###### Python
  Why was the language created?
  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems. (From Python) I think python was created to bridge the gap between C and the shell.  
        
  * ###### Swift
  Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touchframeworks and the large body of extant Objective-C (ObjC) code written for Apple products. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6. On platforms other than Linux,[9] it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.(from Wikipedia). In my view, Swift is a language including C, C++, Objective -C but more effective. Swift was simply a clean-slate approach, apparently taking cues from many different places. It also strove to be easy to learn while containing some powerful features, all with quite minimal syntax.
  
What problems was the language trying to address?
 * ###### Python
 I think Python wins in the texts processing compared with other scripting languages, Python is very simpler than others languages. In addition, Google, Yahoo, NASA and other large companies widely used python to achieve a variety of functions. Moreover, Python greatly reduces the number of lines of code written by the program.
 * ###### Swift
 Swift helps address common programming errors like null pointers, and provides syntactic sugar to avoid the pyramid of doom that can otherwise result. More fundamentally, Swift adds the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes. Apple promotes this as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming".(from Wikipedia)
 I also think Swift is designed to be more flexible than Objective-C error coe(“more secure”), more concise. However, it supports many of the core concepts associated with Objective-C; in particular, dynamic scheduling, extensive post-binding, extensible programming, and similar functionality.


Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* ###### Python
Python is a great candidate to substitute C++ in many problem domains. I don't think Python is a replacement for another language or is a reaction to previous language. However, in some way, Python can replace Java. Such as:
Hello Wolrd In JAVA
   - Code Example:
        ```java
       class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
       }

        ```
Hello World In Python
  - Code Example:
     ```Python
      print “Hello World”
     ```
In the same program, Python is more easier and close to English. This lets the programmer focus more the program they are designing and not get riled up in tricky syntax and keywords.

* ###### Swift
Replace Objecitve- C.

#### 2. Unique features of the language

Does the language have any particularly unique features?
* ###### Python
Features of Python: 
Simple: Python is a simple and simple language. Reading a good Python program feels like reading English (but very strict English!). Python's pseudo-code nature is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to focus on the solution to the problem, not the grammar itself.
Easy to Learn:
As you can see, Python is easy to get started. Python has a very simple syntax, as described earlier.
Embeddable:
You can embed Python into a C / C ++ program to provide scripting functionality for the program's users.
Portable:
Because of its open source nature, Python has been ported to many platforms (i.e., to make it work). All Python programs can run on any of these platforms without any changes. However, you must be careful to avoid any function that depends on the system.
* ###### Swift
Syntactic sugar
```Swift
	NSString *str = @"hello,";
	str = [str stringByAppendingString:@" world"];
	var str = "hello,"
	str += " world"
 ```
  
File handing
Swift supports five access control levels for symbols: open, public, internal, file private, and private. Unlike many object-oriented languages, these access controls ignore the inheritance hierarchy: private that the symbol can only be accessed within a direct range, file private means that can only be accessed from within the file, the internal representation can be accessed in the include module that indicates that it can be from any Module access, and opening (only for classes and their methods) indicates that the class can be subclassed outside the module

#### 3. Name spaces
* ###### Python
How are name spaces implemented?
Documentation：A namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules may both define a function maximize without confusion — users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.
How are name spaces used?
```Python
	def scope_test():
    def do_local():
        dog = "local dog"

    def do_nonlocal():
        nonlocal dog
        dog = "nonlocal dog"

    def do_global():
        global dog
        dog = "global dog"

    spam = "test dog"
    do_local()
    print("After local assignment:", dog)
    do_nonlocal()
    print("After nonlocal assignment:", dog)
    do_global()
    print("After global assignment:", dog)

scope_test()
print("In global scope:", dog)

Output:
After local assignment: test dog
After nonlocal assignment: nonlocal dog
After global assignment: nonlocal dog
In global scope: global dog


 ```
 * ###### Swift
How are name spaces implemented?
Namespaces are not per-file; they're per-target (based on the "Product Module Name" build setting). So you'd end up with something like this:
```Swift
  import FrameworkA
  import FrameworkB
  FrameworkA.foo()
 ```
All Swift declarations are considered to be part of some module, so even when you say "NSLog" (yes, it still exists) you're getting what Swift thinks of as "Foundation.NSLog".

How are name spaces used?
```Swift
let apiService = ApiService.sharedInstance
	

	apiService.makeCall(.Login(user: "useraname", password: "password"))
	apiService.makeCall(.ListFriends)


```

 



#### 4. Types
* ###### Python
What types does the language support?
1.Built-in Types
2.Typing
Are both reference and value types supported?
Yes, Python can
Reference:
```Python
def try_to_change_string_reference(the_string):
    print('got', the_string)
    the_string = 'In a kingdom by the sea'
    print('set to', the_string)

outer_string = 'It was many and many a year ago'

print('before, outer_string =', outer_string)
try_to_change_string_reference(outer_string)
print('after, outer_string =', outer_string)
Output:
before, outer_string = It was many and many a year ago
got It was many and many a year ago
set to In a kingdom by the sea
after, outer_string = It was many and many a year ago


```
Passed to a method
```Python
def try_to_change_list_contents(the_list):
    print('got', the_list)
    the_list.append('four')
    print('changed to', the_list)

outer_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']

print('before, outer_list =', outer_list)
try_to_change_list_contents(outer_list)
print('after, outer_list =', outer_list)
Output:
before, outer_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']
got ['one', 'two', 'three']
changed to ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
after, outer_list = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
```
Passed as aparameter:
```Python
def try_to_change_list_reference(the_list):
    print('got', the_list)
    the_list = ['and', 'we', 'can', 'not', 'lie']
    print('set to', the_list)

outer_list = ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']

print('before, outer_list =', outer_list)
try_to_change_list_reference(outer_list)
print('after, outer_list =', outer_list)
Output:
before, outer_list = ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']
got ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']
set to ['and', 'we', 'can', 'not', 'lie']
after, outer_list = ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']

```
Can new value types be created?
Python can use the NewType() helper function to create distinct types.
```Python
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
some_id = UserId(14203175)
def get_user_name(user_id: UserId) -> str:
    ...

# typechecks
user_a = get_user_name(UserId(123456))

# does not typecheck; an int is not a UserId
user_b = get_user_name(-1)
# 'output' is of type 'int', not 'UserId'
output = UserId(14203175) + UserId(123456)
```
Classes
Class definitions, like function definitions (def statements) must be executed before they have any effect. (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an if statement, or inside a function.)
Defining
	The simplest form of class definition looks like this:
```Python	
  class ClassName:
	    <statement-1>
	    .
	    .
	    .
	    <statement-N>
```   
Creating new instances
```Python
•	x.counter = 1
•	while x.counter < 10:
•	    x.counter = x.counter * 2
•	print x.counter
•	del x.counter
```
Constructing/initializing
•	The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. Also known as the __init__ method.
